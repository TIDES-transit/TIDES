# TIDES

Transit ITS Data Exchange Specification (TIDES) for historical transit operation data.

This repository provides data schemas and tools to support the access, management, and improvement of historical transit operations data, including vehicle operations, passenger activity, fare collection, and other similar data.

## TIDES specification

The TIDES specification is maintained in the `/spec` sub-directory as a series of JSON tables compatible with the [frictionless data](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/) table schema standards.
Human-friendlier documentation is auto-generated and available at:

- [Architecture](architecture.md)
- [Table Schemas](tables.md)

## Contributing to TIDES

Those who want to help with the development of the TIDES specification should review the guidance in <CONTRIBUTING.md>.
