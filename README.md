# TIDES

Transit ITS Data Exchange Specification (TIDES) for historical transit operation data.

This repository provides data schemas and tools to support the access, management, and improvement of historical transit operations data, including vehicle operations, passenger activity, fare collection, and other similar data.

## TIDES specification

The TIDES specification is maintained in the `/spec` sub-directory as a series of JSON tables compatible with the [frictionless table schema] standards.
Human-friendlier documentation is auto-generated and available at:

- [Architecture][architecture]
- [Table Schemas][table schemas]

### Data Package

Directories with TIDES data must contain metadata in a [`datapackage.json`][tides-datapackage-profile] file in a format compliant with the [`tides-datapackage-profile`][tides-datapackage-profile] of a [`frictionless data package`][frictionless data package schema].  

[`/samples/template/datapackage.json`][template-datapackage] has a template datapackage which can be used.

## Sample Data

[Sample data][samples] can be found in the `/samples` directory, with one directory for each sample.

### Template

Templates of `datapackage.json` and each TIDES file type are located in the `/samples/template` directory.

## Validating TIDES data

TIDES data with a valid [`datapackage.json`](#data-package) can be easily validated using the [frictionless framework], which can be installed and invoked as follows:

```bash
pip install frictionless
frictionless validate --schema-sync path/to/your/datapackage.json
```

Several other validation scripts and tools with more flexibility such as validating to the canonical, named version or a local spec can be found in the `/bin` directory, with usage available with the `--help` flag.

```bash
bin/validate-datapackage [-v remote_spec_ref | -l local_spec_path] [-d dataset_path]
```
