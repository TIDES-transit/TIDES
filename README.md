# TIDES

Transit ITS Data Exchange Specification (TIDES) for historical transit operation data.

This repository provides data schemas and tools to support the access, management, and improvement of historical transit operations data, including vehicle operations, passenger activity, fare collection, and other similar data.

## TIDES specification

The TIDES specification is maintained in the `/spec` sub-directory as a series of tables specified as a [frictionless data package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/) defined in `/spec/tides.spec.json`, which is a series of [frictionless data tables](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/) schemas specified in the set of files `/spec/*.schema.json`.

Human readable tables describing the schema can be found at [http://tides-transit.github.io/TIDES/architecture](http://tides-transit.github.io/TIDES/architecture).

## Contributing to TIDES

Those who want to help with the development of the TIDES specification should review the guidance in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
