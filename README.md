# TIDES

Transit ITS Data Exchange Specification (TIDES) for historical transit operations data.

This repository provides data schemas and tools to support the access, management, and improvement of historical transit operations data, including vehicle operations, passenger activity, fare collection, and other similar data.

### TIDES specification
The TIDES specification is maintained in the `/spec` sub-directory as a series of JSON tables.

Data Table schemas
Data table schemas are specified in JSON and are compatible with the [frictionless data](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/) table schema standards.

## Issues
Please add issues, bugs, and feature requests to [GitHub](https://github.com/TIDES-transit/TIDES).
