## Becoming a TIDES Contributor

As defined in the [TIDES Governance][TIDES-governance], a [TIDES-Contributor][TIDES-contributor] has the rights to:

- Create issues, discussions, and pull requests in the TIDES repository.
- Vote in decisions on changes to the TIDES spec and other aspects of TIDES.

These roles and responsibilities are further detailed in the [TIDES Governance][TIDES-governance] and documents linked to from it.  

Individuals may request to be a Contributor by completing [the registration form][contributor registration form]that includes acknowledgement of the [Contributor Agreement](#tides-contributor-license-agreement) and [Code of Conduct](#tides-code-of-conduct).

## How to Contribute

1. Become a [TIDES Contributor](#becoming-a-tides-contributor)
2. Follow [setup](#setup) instructions if you'd like to contribute code or provide code reviews.
3. Offer to help research an issue
4. Offer to help resolve an issue with a pull-request
5. Offer to review a pull-request

!!! warning

    By making any contribution to the projects, contributors self-certify to the [Contributor Agreement](#tides-contributor-license-agreement).

### Setup

1. Make sure you have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
2. Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), a terminal (e.g. Mac Terminal, CygWin, etc.), and a text editor installed on your local machine. Optionally, you will likely find it easier to use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), an IDE instead of a simple text editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), etc.
3. [Clone the repository locally](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository). Non-registered contributors should [fork the repository](https://github.com/TIDES-transit/TIDES/fork) first, since they will be unable to push branches directly to the main repository.
4. Install development requirements packages `pip install -r requirements.txt` or in a virtual environment.

!!! tip "Using a virtual environment"

    It is often helpful to install requirements for vairous projects inside a virtual environment rather than in your main python installation. Some virtual environments to consider include: [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/),[`pipenv`](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html),[`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/), and [`rye`](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/rye).

### Contribution Workflow

1. [Create a feature branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) to work on a new issue (or checkout an existing one where the issue is being worked on).  
2. Make your changes.
3. Run `tests/test_local_spec` script to check and fix formatting, validate profile and schemas with frictionless and with each other, and confirm that documentation can be built locally.
4. Run `tests/test_samples_to_local` script to check if samples conform to any changes to the spec.
5. [Commit](#commits) your work in `git`
6. `push` your changes to Github and submit a [`pull request`](#pull-requests)

!!! tip "Create a feature branch on a clone of `tides-transit/TIDES`, not a fork"

    If you have the permissions (which you should if you are a TIDE Contributor), you should complete your work on a feature branch from a **clone** of the main TIDES repository (`tides-transit/TIDES`) rather than a fork of it (e.g. `my-github-handle/TIDES`) so that when you submit a pull request the continuous integration tests will have the right permissions to run. 

### Issues

Create issues to start discussion on a new topic. If the issue is associated with a pull
request, be sure to link the two. There are shortcuts [here](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword)

### Pull Requests

Use the following guidance in creating and responding to pull requests

- Keep pull requests small and focused. One issue is best.
- Link Pull Requests to Issues as appropriate.
- Complete the pull request template as best you can.
- In order to run all GitHub Actions automations, contributors with adequate permissions (i.e. Registered Contributors) should submit pull requests from a branch on the main repo, rather than from a fork.

!!! tip "If you worked from a fork"

    If you worked from a fork of the `TIDES/tides-transit` repo instead of a feature branch of a clone of the `TIDES/tides-transit` repo, you will not have the right permissions to run the continuous integration tests when you submit a pull request.  To remedy, please push the branch of your local fork to a feature branch of the main repository:

    ```sh
    git remote add upstream git@github.com/TIDES-transit/TIDES.git
    git push upstream <my-feature-branch-name>
    ``` 

    ...and now you should be able to submit a pull request from that feature branch which should have the permission to run the continuous integration tests.

    Run into a permissions issue with that command? Make sure you a registered contributor and that you have accepted the resulting invitation to join the `tides-transit` team on Github. 

### Commits

Use the following guidance for commits

- Provide a short, clear title. Capitalize. No period at the end
- Wrap the body of text at 72 characters

### Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment

We leverage [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflows to flag potentially erronious contributions and build, preview and deploy documentation that is in sync with the schema definition files.

Workflows are defined in `/.github/workflows/` include the following:

| **File** | **Description** |
| ------- | ----- |
| `validate_package_schema.yml` | Validates Data Package definition |
| `validate_table_schemas.yml` | Validates Schema Files |
| `docs.yml` | Builds and deploys documentation |

### Documentation

The documentation for the TIDES specification is available at <https://tides-transit.github.io/TIDES/> This site is automatically recreated each time a change is made to the specification.
