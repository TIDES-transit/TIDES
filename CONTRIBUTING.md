# Contributing to TIDES

Thank you for contributing to the TIDES Project. This document defines the roles and process for contributing to the project and documents the governance roles and approach for decision-making.

## Roles

There are two types of contributors to TIDES:

* Registered Contributors can create and respond to issues and can generate and comment on pull requests, and
* All other Stakeholders can create and respond to issues.

All contributors and stakeholders are asked to adhere to the [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct).

To become a registered Contributor, fill out the registration form at [this link][contributor-registration].

## How to Contribute

Contributions should be offered through GitHub issues and pull requests.

By making any contribution to the projects, contributors self-certify to the [Contributor Agreement](#contributor-agreement).

### Setup

1. Make sure you have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
2. Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), a terminal (e.g. Mac Terminal, CygWin, etc.), and a text editor installed on your local machine. Optionally, you will likely find it easier to use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), an IDE instead of a simple text editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), etc.
3. [Clone the repository locally](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository). Non-registered contributors should [fork the repository](https://github.com/TIDES-transit/TIDES/fork) first, since they will be unable to push branches directly to the main repository.
4. Install development requirements packages `pip install -r requirements.txt` or in a virtual environment.

!!! tip "Using a virtual environment"

    It is often helpful to install requirements for vairous projects inside a virtual environment rather than in your main python installation. Some virtual environments to consider include: [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/),[`pipenv`](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html),[`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/), and [`rye`](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/rye).

### Contribution Workflow

1. [Create a branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) to work on a new issue (or checkout an existing one where the issue is being worked on).  
2. Make your changes.
3. Run `tests/test_local_spec` script to check and fix formatting, validate profile and schemas with frictionless and with each other, and confirm that documentation can be built locally.
4. Run `tests/test_samples_to_local` script to check if samples conform to any changes to the spec.
5. [Commit](#commits) your work in `git`
6. `push` your changes to Github and submit a [`pull request`](#pull-requests)

### Issues

Create issues to start discussion on a new topic. If the issue is associated with a pull
request, be sure to link the two. There are shortcuts [here](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword)

### Pull Requests

Use the following guidance in creating and responding to pull requests

* Keep pull requests small and focused. One issue is best.
* Link Pull Requests to Issues as appropriate.
* Complete the pull request template as best you can.
* In order to run all GitHub Actions automations, contributors with adequate permissions (i.e. Registered Contributors) should submit pull requests from a branch on the main repo, rather than from a fork.

### Commits

Use the following guidance for commits

* Provide a short, clear title. Capitalize. No period at the end
* Wrap the body of text at 72 characters

### Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment

We leverage [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflows to flag potentially erronious contributions and build, preview and deploy documentation that is in sync with the schema definition files.

Workflows are defined in `/.github/workflows/` include the following:

| **File** | **Description** |
| ------- | ----- |
| `validate_package_schema.yml` | Validates Data Package definition |
| `validate_table_schemas.yml` | Validates Schema Files |
| `docs.yml` | Builds and deploys documentation |

??? info "`docs.yml` Process"

    setup-python --> pip["pip install docs/requirements.txt"]
    pip["pip install docs/requirements.txt"] --> gh_mike["mike"]
    gh_mike["mike"] --> gh-pages/branch-name
    ```

### Documentation

The documentation for the TIDES specification is available at <https://tides-transit.github.io/TIDES/> This site is automatically recreated each time a change is made to the specification.

When a change is pushed to the TIDES specification repository, Github Actions deployes the workflow `docs.yml` that rebuilds the files for the TIDES documentation site. When a pull request is opened from a branch on the main repository, a draft version of the docs is built for preview purposes via the same process. For security purposes, documentation is not automatically built on pull requests opened from forks.

    | **Name** |  **What it does** |
    | -------- | ----------------- |
    |`/.github/workflows/docs.yml` | <ul><li>Sets up python</li><li>Loads resources from /docs/requirements.txt</li><li>Runs mike</li></ul> |
    | `/docs/requirements.txt` | Lists resources needed to generate documentation |
    | `/mkdocs.yml` | Controls mkdocs:<ul><li>Defines look and feel of mkdocs</li><li>Specifies which mkdocs plug-ins to use</li><li>Specifies that mkdocs-macros should be used</li><li>Defines the structure of the documentation site</li><li>References /`docs/*.md` files as the major sections of the site</li></ul>
    | `main.py` | Defines macros used by mkdocs-macros, which can be referenced in the various markdown documentation files to generate markdown content, including from the Frictionless spec .json files |
    | `/docs/*.md` | These markdown files contain the content for the documentation site, either directly or by reference. |
    | `/docs/index.md` | Documentation homepage using content from README.me |
    | `/docs/architecture.md` | Documents the overall spec architcture using a list of spec tables generated from `tides.spec.json` and diagrams the relationships between tables with mermaid |
    | `/docs/tables.md` | Documents the detailed schemas for each table generated from `/spec/*.schema.json` |
    | `/docs/development.md` | Documents spec development processes using content from CONTRIBUTING.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md |

??? info "Tools Used in TIDES Documentation"

    | **Name** |  **What it does** |
    | -------- | ----------------- |
    | GitHub Actions | Runs following workflow on each push to the TIDES github repository:  /.github/workflows/docs.yml |
    | mike | runs mkdocs and puts output in a folder in gh_pages branch which corresponds to the name of the branch (i.e. main, develop, pr-163, etc) <br> For new branches with documentation, adds an entry in `versions.json` |
    | `mkdocs` | Package which generates documentation from markdown and code |
